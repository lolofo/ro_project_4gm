# Operational research project (one machine sequencing problem)

## Work on the subject

The goal is to implement a branch and bound algorithm. We will have two types of branch and bound algorithms to code.

* The first algorithm will be based on the **Schrage** technique to find upper and lower bounds at each branch node. Everything will be based on this Schrage procedure. At each node we will have to do this procedure and a criterion will allow us to branch.

* a second branch and bound algorithm can be based on mixed programming. It is in fact the classical version of this algorithm. At each node we consider a linear relaxation, which we solve (dual simplex/simplex algorithm).
